This Git repository contains all of the labs and assignments I have completed for Comp20 - Web  Development. 
2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
I really liked the security lab because there was a lot of creative freedom involved with hacking my partner's code. Additionally, I think cybersecurity is becoming more relevant today and I thought that this lab was a great introduction into what cybersecurity is. 
3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
Through this class, I was able to learn new programming languages and become a more well-rounded programmer. In the beginning, javascript was very challenging for me, and now at the end of the class, I feel confident in my javascript skills. 
4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
I learned that stackoverflow is a very important resource for programmers. Many people in the online community have the same programming problems as me, and it was helpful to learn from their questions. Second, I learned that
in cybersecurity, you should never trust user input. Instead, you should set up precautions to make sure that they aren't abusing the input.

After this course, I would love to take comp116 and learn more about cybersecurity.
